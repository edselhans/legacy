        <p class="review__p">A superbly crafted and thoroughly original novel, "Legacy" is a fascinating read from beginning to end and documents author Michael Woodworth Fuller has an author of considerable and impressive talent. Very highly recommended for personal reading lists.</p>
        <h2 class="review__title"><em>Review by <a class="review__link" href="http://www.warrendeacon.com/" target="_blank">Warren John Deacon</a></em></h2>
        <p class="review__p">With <em>Legacy</em>, Michael Woodworth Fuller has painstakingly undermined and thumbed his censorious nose at the outmoded contemporary war novel,
          completely thrown the baby-out-with-the-bath-water in the endless, tedious academic masturbation that surrounds the relationship of plot and character to language,
          and trashed most of what we believe about the relevance of war in our deferential politically-correct culture.</p>
        <p>How he does this exactly is impossible to say. All good writers take their secrets of technique to the grave and they wouldn't be caught dead teaching them in trendy university writing classes.
          Fuller pretty much eschews literary rules and conventions and, rather cleverly and clandestinely,
          stitches into his tightly-wound nightmarish narrative all of the essential elements of the classic novel form:
          a plot that rushes forward ruthlessly; a deep and richly purified character study of a man inundated in a tsunami of existentialism -- ending in a bone-crushing Cri de Coeur; and a commanding,
          pitiless consciousness that gnaws on the broken carcass of the reader's assumptions, if not his flesh, long after the book has been read.</p>
        <p>But Fuller is impatient with a mere tale well-told. He has seriously upped the ante, fashioning his courageous, gutty,
          blood-soaked story in language so utterly potent and unique and elevated that it often threatens to overwhelm the narrative, the central character and ultimately the reader.</p>
        <p>This may well be precisely what Fuller aims to do and he never waivers in his charge. This is not melodrama. Nor is it opera, rock opera, soap opera. Not theater, pop song or Broadway musical,
          TV commercial or late night infomercial, iPhone, Youtube, videogame, radio jingle or any other literary form except pure literary fiction in novel form.</p>
        <p>In crude summary, it's the story of an intelligent, very, very young man who winds up on a battlefield in Southeast Asia where he was never welcome and where he never should have been
          and who watches in horror while young men die and who participates in the incineration of an innocent child and who gets part of his body blown away and who comes back to a civilization that is entirely indifferent to his suffering,
          a culture that has become jaded and insipid, and has turned into the comforting winds of consumerism and gratification.</p>
        <p>But <em>Legacy</em> is much, much more. For how can a conscientious author cobble together such a shattering chronicle when all he has to work with is the tedious, adenoidal rationality of standard American English?</p>
        <p>The answer is, of course, that he can't.</p>
        <p>And Fuller doesn't. Do not misunderstand. This is not poetry. It's prose, often of the sturdiest stock. Sometimes bordering on melancholy, but never sentimental. That's a trick in itself and Fuller is the star in his own very distinct magic show.</p>
        <p>And the language! It glides. Dare I say <em>soars</em>? (My inadequacy, not Fuller's.) Plummets, dives, drops, rises, only to fall, again and again, in a devastating crescendo of human despair and unbearable pain.
          And the rhythm – Fuller often riffs wildly with the best of them -- now Dixieland resolute, then precipitously Coltrane cool, and now West Coast Mulligan progressive and never a hint of that valueless dreck now known as Smooth Jazz.</p>
        <p>This is not a Smooth Novel nor is Fuller a Smooth Novelist. He's painfully honest. He gets gallingly under your skin and in your head. And inside your heart.
          This is not a stress-free midsummer shoreline read. It's tough and demanding and unflinching. Some of the sexual scenes are incendiary and upsetting.
          Many descriptions, particularly of the protagonist's injuries, are cruel and disgusting. The deaths – of a few of the principal characters – and the many emotional deaths that litter the fictional landscape like trash on the interstate, are unsympathetic and very, very desolate. Oddly like death itself.</p>
        <p><em>Legacy</em> does what all really significant novels do. It holds not only your feet, but your face, to the fire, demands that you confront the void that lies just below the surface and asks two very simple questions,
          simultaneously related and random, questions of a child or an idiot or a wise man: What is war? And why do we tolerate it?</p>
        <p>I think, like all serious artists, Fuller is writing mostly for himself. Not to impress, nor entertain, not for fame or favor, but to challenge, encounter and inform himself and coincidentally his reader.
          This work is not a poorly disguised blueprint for a Hollywood blockbuster and it's not likely to become a best seller. Too tough. Too uncompromising.
          But if you consider yourself a serious student and a wildly unapologetic fan of literature who has never given up on the intimate promise of a damn good read that stops your clock for a brief moment, it should be another landmark on your journey.
          It's a frightening song. Honest and without pity. But it brings the most immense joy in the singing.</p>

        <p class="review__p">When you read this book, be prepared to be challenged. You will be challenged with word choice and you will be challenged to pay attention to every line. You can never drop your guard. This is not a light book. The author has chosen his words and the structure of his writing carefully.</p>
        <p>Not an easy read. It never falls short of its target. Like a good movie where you never see the actors acting, in this book the characters never behave out of character. Their choices, even if brutal, are always true.</p>
